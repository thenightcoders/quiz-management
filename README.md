# quiz-management
Comprehensive online platform for managing both quiz competitions and the participants in the different teams.

The application permits multiple admins, each having their unique user id and password. While admins can create an “n” number of participating teams for a quiz, they can also set an “n” number of rounds for the quiz. All the participants will automatically receive the questions, and the teams will have to answer within an allotted time.

In case a team is unable to answer a question or gives the wrong answer, they’ll receive negative marking. The teams having the lowest average score will be eliminated, and the remaining teams will continue to compete in the next level. This will continue until the winner is declared. The scores for each team will be automatically updated. And this is the perfect idea for your next Java project!
